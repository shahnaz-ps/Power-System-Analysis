# Power System Analysis Project

This repository contains the files and documentation for the Power System Analysis project completed as part of the Electrical Energy Systems Analysis course.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to conduct a contingency analysis on a simplified power grid. Using PowerWorld Simulator, we analyze various failure scenarios, verify system stability under these contingencies, and identify necessary modifications to maintain grid operation within safe limits. The project involves calculating power flows, identifying voltage violations, and suggesting corrective actions.

## Files

- **PowerSystem_Project.pwb**: PowerWorld Simulator file containing the power system model.
- **PowerSystemReport.pdf**: Detailed report of the project's methodology, results, and conclusions.
- **EESA1-Project-14022.pdf**: Problem statement and project guidelines from the Electrical Energy Systems Analysis course.

## Key Analysis Steps

1. **Base Case Load Flow**: Analyze the initial conditions of the power grid to ensure all voltages and power flows are within acceptable limits.
2. **Contingency Analysis**: Perform `n-1` analysis by removing one line at a time and documenting the effect on the grid's stability and power flows.
3. **Violation Reporting**: Identify instances where voltage levels or power flows exceed limits under contingency conditions.
4. **Suggested Mitigations**: Propose feasible solutions to bring the system back within safe operating limits, such as adjusting generator outputs, installing reactive power compensation, or modifying line capacities.

## Requirements

- **Software**: PowerWorld Simulator
